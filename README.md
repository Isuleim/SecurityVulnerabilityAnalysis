# Cybersecurity SecurityVulnerability Project
This project focuses on analyzing security vulnerabilities in software components using Python. It includes the generation of synthetic datasets representing software attributes, such as version, patch level, and security risk factors. The project performs data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and vulnerability risk classification using machine learning models. Additionally, we leverage key cybersecurity tools like Bandit to identify security issues in Python code, and we provide visualizations to help interpret the model outputs. This project showcases in Python, data analysis, and cybersecurity executions.
